DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts to find these.

The DirBuster Lists

DirBuster comes with a set of unique directory and files lists, these have been generated based on the file and directory names that are actually used by developers on internet sites. The order of the lists is based on the frequency of the item found. Therefore the most common items appear at the top. These lists are what make DirBuster.

NOTE: It will come as no surprise to you all that the internet is full of porn, thus it not surprising that the spider used to generate the lists visited a few along the way. Thus there are explicit words contained within the lists. My stand point on this is simple, this tool was designed to used as part of legitimate security testing, and if there are directories/files based on explicit words, clients would want to know!!

The following lists are included with DirBuster, or as a separate download:

    directory-list-2.3-small.txt - (87650 words) - Directories/files that where found on at least 3 different hosts
    directory-list-2.3-medium.txt - (220546 words) - Directories/files that where found on at least 2 different hosts
    directory-list-2.3-big.txt - (1273819 words) - All directories/files that where found
    directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt - (81629 words) - Case insensitive version of directory-list-2.3-small.txt
    directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt - (207629 words) - Case insensitive version of directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
    directory-list-lowercase-2.3-big.txt - (1185240 words) - Case insensitive version of directory-list-2.3-big.txt
    directory-list-1.0.txt - (141694 words) - Original unordered list
    apache-user-enum-1.0.txt - (8916 usernames) - Used for guessing system users on apache with the userdir module enabled, based on a username list I had lying around (unordered)
    apache-user-enum-2.0.txt - (10341 usernames) - Used for guessing system users on apache with the userdir module enabled, based on ~XXXXX found during list generation (Ordered)
