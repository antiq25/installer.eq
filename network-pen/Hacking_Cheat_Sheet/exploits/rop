ROP (Return Oriented Proragmming ) Attack

This type of attack was introduced by Hovav Shacham of Stanford University in his paper “The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone:Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86).” 

That means this type of attack is able to perform arbitrary computation without the necessary use of library functions by reusing code chunks which he calls GADGETS.

There are certain gadgets that allows us to store and load data from one place to another. Modes of transfer include:
