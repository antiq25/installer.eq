Exploitation

Remote Exploits

Before you can attack, you must choose your weapon. Armitage makes this process easy. Use Attacks -> Find Attacks to generate a custom Attack menu for each host.

To exploit a host: right-click it, navigate to Attack, and choose an exploit. To show the right attacks, make sure the operating system is set for the host.

The Attack menu limits itself to exploits that meet a minimum exploit rank of great. Some useful exploits are ranked good and they won't show in the attack menu. You can launch these using the module browser.

Use Armitage -> Set Exploit Rank to change the minimum exploit rank.

Optionally, if you'd like to see hosts that are vulnerable to a certain exploit, browse to the exploit in the module browser. Right-click the module. Select Relevant Targets. Armitage will create a dynamic workspace that shows hosts that match the highlighted exploit. Highlight all of the hosts and double-click the exploit module to attack all of them at once.
