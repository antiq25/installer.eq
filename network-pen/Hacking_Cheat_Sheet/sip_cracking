VoIPong is a utility which detects all Voice over IP calls on a pipeline, and for those which are G711 encoded, dumps actual conversation to separate wave files. It supports SIP, H323, Cisco's Skinny Client Protocol, RTP and RTCP. 

- voipong -c etc/voipong.conf -d4 -f

Vomit converts a Cisco IP phone RTP conversation into a wave file that can be played with ordinary sound players. Vomit requires a tcpdump output file.

- vomit-r sip.dump | waveplay -S8000 -B16 -C1
