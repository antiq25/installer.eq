SMTP ENUM


SMTP Enumeration allows you to determine valid users on the SMTP server. This is accomplished with the help of three built-in SMTP commands. The three commands are:

> VRFY - This command is used for validating users
> EXPN - This command tells the actual delivery address of aliases and mailing lists
> RCPT TO - It defines the recipients of the message
