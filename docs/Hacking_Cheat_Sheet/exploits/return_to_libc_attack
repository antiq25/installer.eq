Return-to-libc attack

A “return-to-libc” attack is a computer security attack usually starting with a buffer overflow in which a subroutine return address on a call stack is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the process’ executable memory, bypassing the NX bit feature (if present) and ridding the attacker of the need to inject their own code.
